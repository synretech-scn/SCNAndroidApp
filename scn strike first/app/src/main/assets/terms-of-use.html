mso-ansi-language:EN">XBowling requires access to the Internet, typically through a cellular data network or a local Wi-Fi network. 
The quality of your XBowling experience may vary depending on the strength and consistency of your wireless connection. 
If your bowling center has Wi-Fi, we recommend that you connect to it since it can be challenging to get a good cellular signal within metal-framed buildings such as bowling centers.
In any case, we are not responsible for the quality of your Internet access, and we makes no representations or warranties about the quality of your experience on your device. 
Further, a poor Internet connection may result in a poor XBowling experience, and it is solely your responsibility to establish a quality Internet connection.
The time it takes to launch the Site or Application, or to update screens within the Site or Application will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, 
available bandwidth at the time, and the configuration of your device. 
The availability of XBowling will change from time to time. The quality of the display of bowling scores, challenges, and other Site and Application functions may vary from device to device, 
and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection.  
Availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. You are responsible for all Internet access charges. 
Please check with your Internet or cellular provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges.
